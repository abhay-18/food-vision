        "* [`shuffle()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shuffle) - randomly shuffles the elements of a target dataset up `buffer_size` (ideally, the `buffer_size` is equal to the size of the dataset, however, this may have implications on memory)\n",
        "* [`batch()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#batch) - turns elements of a target dataset into batches (size defined by parameter `batch_size`)\n",

        "* Extra: [`cache()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#cache) - caches (saves them for later) elements in a target dataset, saving loading time (will only work if your dataset is small enough to fit in memory, standard Colab instances only have 12GB of memory)\n",

        "Things to note:\n",
        "- Can't batch tensors of different shapes (e.g. different image sizes, need to reshape images first, hence our `preprocess_img()` function)\n",
        "- `shuffle()` keeps a buffer of the number you pass it images shuffled, ideally this number would be all of the samples in your training set, however, if your training set is large, this buffer might not fit in memory (a fairly large number like 1000 or 10000 is usually suffice for shuffling)\n",
        "- For methods with the `num_parallel_calls` parameter available (such as `map()`), setting it to`num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` will parallelize preprocessing and significantly improve speed\n",
